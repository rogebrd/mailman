# Project Mailman

Project Mailman is a project originally created as a part of Dropbox's Hackweek 2021

Email remains one of the only mediums on the internet that we are unable to use links to reference. Project Mailman is the solution for this. 

By simply forwarding an email, mailman backs up the forwarded email thread and exports it to a file saved in the user's Dropbox.
